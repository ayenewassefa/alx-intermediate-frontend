🧩 Step 1: Check if Node.js is installed

Open the terminal / command prompt and run:

node -v


If it shows a version number like v18.17.0, Node.js is already installed.
If not, download and install it from https://nodejs.org
 (choose the LTS version).

⚙️ Step 2: Install SASS globally using npm

Once Node.js is installed, run this command in the terminal (not inside Node):

npm install -g sass


npm = Node Package Manager

-g = installs globally so you can use sass command anywhere

This downloads and installs SASS on your system.

🧪 Step 3: Verify the installation

After the installation completes, check that SASS works:

sass --version


If you see output like:

1.80.3 compiled with dart2js 3.4.0


✅ Success — SASS is installed and ready.



sass --watch styles/main.scss styles/main.css
